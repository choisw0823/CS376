"Languages evolve differences because different groups of people independently develop different words and different pronunciations over the course of time. But the question remains why those diverged languages don¡¯t merge again when formerly separated people spread out and re-contact each other at speech boundaries. For instance, at the modern boundary between Germany and Poland, there are Polish villages near German villages, but the villagers still speak a local variety of either German or of Polish, rather than a mix of German and Polish. Why is that so? Probably the main disadvantage of speaking a mixed language involves a basic function of human language: as soon as you start to speak to someone else, your language serves as an instantly recognizable badge of your ___. It¡¯s much easier for wartime spies to wear the enemy¡¯s uniform than to imitate convincingly the enemy¡¯s language and pronunciation. People who speak your language are your people, whereas someone speaking a different language is apt to be regarded as a potentially dangerous stranger.

"Our craving for ___ is illustrated by a study of religious Israeli women, carried out by anthropologists Richard Sosis and W. Penn Handwerker. During the 2006 Lebanon War the town of Tzfat and its environs in the Galilee region of northern Israel were hit by dozens of rockets daily. Although siren warnings alerted Tzfat residents to protect their own lives by taking refuge in bomb shelters, they could do nothing to protect their houses. Realistically, that threat from the rockets was unpredictable and uncontrollable. Nevertheless, about two-thirds of the women interviewed by Sosis and Handwerker recited psalms every day to cope with the stress of the rocket attacks. When they were asked why they did so, a common reply was that they felt compelled ¡°to do something¡± as opposed to doing nothing at all. Although reciting psalms does not actually deflect rockets, it did provide the women with a sense of control as they took action in their own way.

Sometimes, however, if a person is already sensitive and upset about something, delaying feedback can be wise. Use your critical thinking skills to analyze when feedback will do the most good.

"Think of how you developed your style of using the brakes on your car. As you were mastering the skill of taking curves, you gradually learned when to let go of the accelerator and when and how hard to use the brakes. Curves differ, and the variability you experienced while learning ensures that you are now ready to brake at the right time and strength for any curve you encounter. The conditions for learning this skill are ideal, because you receive immediate and unambiguous feedback every time you go around a bend: the mild reward of a comfortable turn or the mild punishment of some difficulty in handling the car if you brake either too hard or not quite hard enough.

But having larger feet does not cause anyone to gain a larger vocabulary; nor does having a large vocabulary cause your feet to grow. The obvious explanation of the correlation is that children tend to have much smaller feet than adults, and, because children acquire their vocabularies gradually as they grow older, it is hardly surprising that, on average, people with smaller feet have smaller vocabularies.
