"Languages evolve differences because different groups of people independently develop different words and different pronunciations over the course of time. But the question remains why those diverged languages don¡¯t merge again when formerly separated people spread out and re-contact each other at speech boundaries. For instance, at the modern boundary between Germany and Poland, there are Polish villages near German villages, but the villagers still speak a local variety of either German or of Polish, rather than a mix of German and Polish. Why is that so? Probably the main disadvantage of speaking a mixed language involves a basic function of human language: as soon as you start to speak to someone else, your language serves as an instantly recognizable badge of your ___. It¡¯s much easier for wartime spies to wear the enemy¡¯s uniform than to imitate convincingly the enemy¡¯s language and pronunciation. People who speak your language are your people, whereas someone speaking a different language is apt to be regarded as a potentially dangerous stranger.

"Our craving for ___ is illustrated by a study of religious Israeli women, carried out by anthropologists Richard Sosis and W. Penn Handwerker. During the 2006 Lebanon War the town of Tzfat and its environs in the Galilee region of northern Israel were hit by dozens of rockets daily. Although siren warnings alerted Tzfat residents to protect their own lives by taking refuge in bomb shelters, they could do nothing to protect their houses. Realistically, that threat from the rockets was unpredictable and uncontrollable. Nevertheless, about two-thirds of the women interviewed by Sosis and Handwerker recited psalms every day to cope with the stress of the rocket attacks. When they were asked why they did so, a common reply was that they felt compelled ¡°to do something¡± as opposed to doing nothing at all. Although reciting psalms does not actually deflect rockets, it did provide the women with a sense of control as they took action in their own way.

"Feedback is usually most effective when you offer it at the earliest opportunity, particularly if your objective is to teach someone a skill. ___, if you are teaching your friend how to make your famous egg rolls, you provide a step-by-step commentary as you watch your pupil. If he makes a mistake, you don¡¯t wait until the egg rolls are finished to tell him that he left out the cabbage. He needs immediate feedback to finish the rest of the sequence successfully. Sometimes, however, if a person is already sensitive and upset about something, delaying feedback can be wise. Use your critical thinking skills to analyze when feedback will do the most good. Rather than automatically offering immediate correction, use the just-in-time approach and provide feedback just before the person might make another mistake.","For example, In addition, Similarly, So, But",For example
"Think of how you developed your style of using the brakes on your car. As you were mastering the skill of taking curves, you gradually learned when to let go of the accelerator and when and how hard to use the brakes. Curves differ, and the variability you experienced while learning ensures that you are now ready to brake at the right time and strength for any curve you encounter. The conditions for learning this skill are ideal, because you receive immediate and unambiguous feedback every time you go around a bend: the mild reward of a comfortable turn or the mild punishment of some difficulty in handling the car if you brake either too hard or not quite hard enough. The situations that face a harbor pilot maneuvering large ships are no less regular, but skill is much more difficult to acquire by sheer experience because of the long delay between actions and their noticeable outcomes.

But having larger feet does not cause anyone to gain a larger vocabulary; nor does having a large vocabulary cause your feet to grow. The obvious explanation of the correlation is that children tend to have much smaller feet than adults, and, because children acquire their vocabularies gradually as they grow older, it is hardly surprising that, on average, people with smaller feet have smaller vocabularies.

The bones of early farmers show evidence of vitamin deficiencies, probably caused by regular periods of starvation between harvests. They also show signs of stress, associated, perhaps, with the intensive labor required for plowing, harvesting crops, felling trees, maintaining buildings and fences, and grinding grains.

"Tom was a professional basketball player. In his last championship game, his mistake caused his team to lose the game. For years after his retirement, he kept thinking about the mistake. When people asked, ¡°Why are you depressed most of the time?¡± he answered, ¡°I was a fool to make such a mistake. How else do you expect me to feel?¡± Even if people told him that it was his thinking that was depressing him, he would say, ¡°No, it isn¡¯t. I¡¯m depressed because I made the mistake, not because I¡¯m thinking about it. In fact, I seldom think about it.¡± Tom didn¡¯t see his thinking as ___.","the cause of his suffering, the result of his practice, the evidence of his talent, the secret of his friendship, the source of his creativity",
"When my son Tony was young, I purchased a model car for children at Christmas. When Tony opened the box, I reviewed the rather difficult instructions and I thought Tony was too young to figure out how to put together this new toy. So, I immediately decided I could get the job done quicker by using my wisdom and skill. Just as I started, my wife came to the back door, looked at the car, and offered me some very valuable advice. ¡°Honey, you don¡¯t want Tony to avoid activities that seem difficult. He must be able to work alone without needing other people¡¯s help. We really need to teach him to be ___.¡± Her advice was simple, yet very true.","ambitious, independent, intelligent, sociable, generous",independent
"The male stickleback fish builds a nest for its eggs. He makes the nest out of water plants and sticks. He makes it in the shape of a barrel and uses a thread-like material from his body to glue the nest together. When the nest is ready, the female fish comes. Once a female stickleback¡¯s job of laying egg is done, she doesn¡¯t return to the nest or see her young again. The male stickleback, however, has more work to do. Besides nest building, his job is to watch over the eggs. For two weeks, the male guards his nest fiercely. He fans oxygen-filled water through the tunnel of the barrel with his fins and repairs any damage to his nest. Protecting this nest is a full-time job, so he doesn¡¯t leave the nest. If other sea animals try to eat the baby sticklebacks, he fights them. He keeps the baby fish safe until they can care for themselves. The stickleback male is ___.","a good father, a private doctor, a lazy worker, an unskilled builder, a stupid soldier",a good father
"There is no factor more essential than ___ to accomplish goals. The path to success is not always uphill, but progress is not always assured. The next milestone is not always in sight, and it is natural to become less motivated and become discouraged. Successful people work toward their goals when encouraged and work harder when discouraged. As others become weak in energy and interest, they keep on. They know the person who can go the hardest for the longest will usually win. If you want something so badly that you feel you have to achieve it immediately, you are likely to experience disappointment and eventually failure. You will get down on yourself and lose selfmotivation and confidence.","continued effort, great talent, a realistic goal, good leadership, a fine teamwork",continued effort
"It is true that when you give love letters to your significant other, it¡¯s really important to maintain the element of ___. But there are certain occasions when that¡¯s impossible. On designated days such as Valentine¡¯s Day, birthdays, and anniversaries, your significant other has high expectations for a lovely gesture. The good news is there are many ways to put new life on old words and actions. If you always deliver glorious gifts, then catch your love off guard by adding some length and thought to the card. If you¡¯re a frequent card giver, then highlight a few details that you have never mentioned, or stress your favorite features in a way you never have before.","truth, surprise, respect, balance, competition",surprise
"The monarch butterfly¡¯s caterpillars have some physical characteristics that make them noticeable to their predators. The caterpillars have yellow, black, and white stripes around their bodies and are unable to move quickly. They are highly visible while they munch their way across leaves. They offer a tasty snack to some insects and to many bigger animals, especially birds. But the monarch caterpillar¡¯s ___ protects it. Any bird that ate a monarch caterpillar would be so ill that it would never touch another. The monarch caterpillars feed on milkweed plants. The milkweed poison that accumulates in the caterpillar¡¯s body remains there even after it changes into the adult butterfly. Consequently the monarch butterfly is also poisonous and remains so throughout its life although adult monarchs feed only on nectar from flowers.","diet, smell, sound, shape, coloration",diet
"If someone ¡®steals your thunder¡¯, they are stealing your ___. There are many great anecdotes that seek to explain the origins of the phrase, some of which are too good to be true, but one of these is both good and true. In 1704 a literary critic and minor playwright named John Dennis was proud to have invented a novel way of creating the sound of thunder, and although the details of the method have been lost in time, what has remained is that his play for which the technique was designed, was a complete failure. Production soon stopped, and within weeks, a run of Macbeth had replaced it in the same theater. On watching this, Dennis got angry to discover that his novel method for making thunder had been stolen, and was used in the play. ¡°Damn them!¡± he yelled. ¡°They will not let my play run, but they steal my thunder!¡±","ideas, identity, money, career, wishes",ideas
"Wetlands are sometimes referred to as nature¡¯s kidneys. It is indeed impressive to see how well wetlands with flow-through characteristics change water chemistry. They generally increase water clarity and remove chemicals such as nitratenitrogen. They also retain or partially remove many of the constituents from water passing through the wetland system, including suspended solids, bacteria, certain heavy metals, and phosphorus. There are thousands of published papers in the past 35 years that have illustrated how natural and constructed wetlands ___.","reduce soil erosion, improve water quality, protect us against floods, are good places for fishing, provide perfect nesting grounds",improve water quality
"Salt is essential to human life even though it¡¯s composed of poisonous chlorine and sodium. Our bodies can not function without salt. We have special taste buds just for it, and we crave it. If we lose too much salt through perspiration or certain medicines, we can become seriously ill. However, too much salt can raise blood pressure to dangerous levels in sensitive individuals or in those with certain medical conditions. So the key to our consumption of salt is ___. Likewise, in our life too much alcohol, food, or stress can damage our well-being. Freeing ourselves from excess and addictions of any kind can be difficult. Don¡¯t be afraid to get professional help when you are in need. And don¡¯t be afraid to tell your problems to your family.","balance and moderation, period and tolerance, avoiding and inhibition, change and abuse, production and distribution",
"When I was young, the last wolf in this part of the country was hunted down and killed. The newcomers to this land brought their long¡©held fears of the wolf with them. They thought, and still think, that the wolf was successful because he loved to kill and was good at it. To them, he was evil and had to be killed. They didn¡¯t realize he failed more than he succeeded. He went hungry nine times out of ten because his prey got away. But he kept trying until he caught it. When he finally succeeded the tenth time with his force of will, he satisfied his hunger. What they saw as a thirst for killing was really ___. That was the secret of his success: He never quit even with difficulty.","greed, cruelty, frustration, cleverness, determination",determination
"Imagine that you are a very small animal. A bird is about to attack and it¡¯s too late to run. What do you do? You try to look ___, even if you¡¯re not. You hope that your new look will frighten away your enemy. Many small animals bluff like this in different ways. The blue-tongued lizard of Australia moves slowly. When frightened, it opens its mouth wide and sticks out a huge blue tongue. It¡¯s not trying to be rude. It just wants to scare its attacker. Most hungry birds leave it alone. When a toad is cornered by a snake, it may puff itself up and stretch out its hind legs. The toad becomes about three times bigger than usual. This makes it look too big for the snake to swallow. If the toad is lucky, the snake goes away to look for prey of its own size.","unattractive, dangerous, bad-tasting, hungry, helpless",dangerous
"¡°Tell it to the Marines!¡± is a well-known expression in the United States. The expression originated in England when the marines were considered inferior to regular soldiers and sailors since they worked on both land and sea and so were regarded by many as foolish. Early in the nineteenth century, England organized a special army known as the British Royal Marines. These men often had to cross the seas to fight in other parts of the world. They were fine soldiers, but knew very little about life at sea. Sailors enjoyed telling these men unbelievable stories. If sailors tried to fool their own shipmates with tall tales, the reply was, ¡°Tell it to the Marines!¡± These sailors knew that only the marines on board would believe such tales. Today¡¯s marines are not so easily tricked, but we still use this expression to show our ___.","emotion, honesty, courage, ambition, disbelief",courage
"There is nothing wrong with ___. I have heard students say that they don¡¯t want to read the poems of other poets because they might begin to write like them. But it is only by writing like the masters ¡ª as an exercise for yourself and as an experiment to find out what you can learn from them ¡ª that you begin to expand your writing skills. It is even valuable to retype poems ¡ª for instance, a sonnet of Shakespeare¡¯s ¡ª in order to examine closely how the poet orders his words, how he turns a line, and what he does with rhyme. Later, as you develop your own style, you will find that you have learned something useful from everyone you have copied and that you have learned something that you will eventually absorb and digest into your own work.","doubt, failure, imitation, impatience, risk-taking",imitation
"A few weeks ago my wife went to a new doctor for her annual physical exam. She had the checkup, and all was well. But as she walked home, she became increasingly upset at how superficial the whole procedure had been. No blood test. No breast exam. The doctor had listened to her heart, taken her blood pressure, and asked her if she had any complaints. That was about it. This didn't seem like an annual physical exam to my wife, so she called the office to see whether there had been some misunderstanding about the purpose of her visit. She described what had occurred to the office manager, who proceeded to tell her that this doctor's philosophy was to have the examinations guided by the desires of the patient. Aside from a few routine examinations, the doctor had no standard procedure for physical exams. Each procedure was a matter of ___ between physician and patient.","equality, privacy, intimacy, negotiation, similarity",negotiation
"A contributing factor to the growth of a fire service organization is ___. Unfortunately, some states do not recognize the need to increase fire department resources until a great loss is experienced as a result of inadequate fire protection. Significant fire losses of property, such as residential areas, million-dollar mansions, historical structures, and valuable wildlands, draw a lot of attention to fire protection needs. The losses associated with inadequate fire protection for major employers and contributors to the local economy generate incentives to support fire protection services. In the worst-case scenario, the citizens' deaths or the line-of-duty deaths of fire fighters resulting from inadequate fire protection will be needed to prompt community leaders to take innovative approaches for fund increases of fire department resources.","community loss, climate change, tax revenue increase, population growth, technological advance",community loss
"When environmentalists lecture us about the need to save the planet, they sometimes emphasize the importance of saving strangers in distant lands, or the generations that will come after us. Alas, the very distance of these ¡°other people¡± works against any attempt to motivate us to help them: we just cannot get excited about saving the livelihoods of people we have never met and cannot even picture. Humans are deeply sociable creatures, and will seize the chance to help others¡ªbut our capacity to do this depends on a(n) ___ that is hard to sustain over great distances of time and place.","imaginative engagement, generational conflict, financial incentive, regional custom, unique identity",imaginative engagement
"Getting to know yourself better takes ___. It is far easier to hide behind a mask than to see yourself as you really are. If you wish to know yourself and change for the better, you need to accept your weaknesses, mistakes, and more. That requires facing the fear of knowing yourself as you are. Most people who are afraid to know themselves, need others present constantly to entertain and distract them. That¡¯s because they are fearful of being still and actually seeing themselves. However, relying on others will only make matters worse. So you need to try to stay totally alone and see who you are, controlling the fear inside you. It will take a lot of nerve, but it is worth it.","courage, strategy, modesty, knowledge, responsibility",courage
"Sometimes an expert has to make a decision quickly when he doesn¡¯t have all the information at hand. In his book, Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm Gladwell describes how experts can make spontaneous decisions that can be better than well-thought-out ones, citing the example of a firefighter who answered a routine call. When his men¡¯s efforts to extinguish the fire failed, the lieutenant realized that something was wrong and ordered his team to get out of the building. A few moments later, the space where they had been standing collapsed. The fire had been under the floor, not in the room itself. When asked how he knew, the fireman couldn¡¯t immediately explain. Had he stopped to analyze the situation, he and his men would have been killed. Instead, he relied on his ___ to tell him what to do.","staff, instinct, gadget, analysis, memory",instinct
" It often feels reasonable to give a ___. With a customer, that may mean saying ""I can do this for between $10,000 and $15,000."" With a new employee, you could be tempted to say, ""You can start between April 1 and April 15."" But that word between tends to suggest that you will take a step back, and any clever negotiator will quickly focus on the cheaper price or the later deadline. In other words, you will find that, by saying the word between, you will get disadvantaged without getting anything in return.","range, job, hint, prize, hand",range
"Jenny Hernandez is the manager of a medium¡©sized company that employs about 25 people. Jenny's leadership has been contributing to the success of the company. One characteristic of Jenny's style is her ___. She does not want to give anyone the impression that certain people have an advantage, and she makes a lot of effort to prevent this from happening. For example, she avoids social lunches because she thinks they create the perception of favoritism. Similarly, even though her best friend is one of the employees, she is seldom seen talking with her, and if she is, it is always about business matters.","fairness, diligence, creativity, confidence, friendliness",fairness
"Modern-day men tend to spend a lot of time and money on their ___. Today, global sales of male grooming products bring in billions of dollars a year, and the industry is not expected to slow down. However, modern man's interest in grooming and cosmetic products is not a new phenomenon. Men in Egypt had their own makeup boxes that comprised special jars of colored makeup which they applied to their eyes, lips, cheeks, and nails. Greek men also applied flower-based oils to their skin. The eye creams, facial masks, and moisturizers that men are buying today are simply different versions of the same idea, one that began 12,000 years ago.","appearance, homes, relationships, healthcare, hobbies",appearance
"Most people know that plants react to light. For instance, if a house plant is near a window, it will start to grow towards the light. But what about sound? New research shows that plants not only react to sound, but even ___ sound themselves. While Dr. Monica Gagliano, a researcher at The University of Western Australia, was working in her herb garden, she started to wonder if plants were sensitive to sounds. She and her colleagues discovered something amazing in their research. They found out that the roots of very young corn plants make clicking sounds although the sounds can't be heard by the human ear. They also found out that when they suspended the roots of corn plants in water, the roots leaned towards the sounds similar to the ""clicking sounds"" the corn seedlings made.","reflect, change, increase, remove, produce",produce
"Children observe and learn from their parents' purchasing behavior, even though parents may not always be aware of it. For example, a child sees the mother squeeze an orange slightly to check if it is fresh, and from this observation he or she learns how to tell whether a fruit is ripe. Similarly, a child observes how the mother reads through the newspapers, cuts the sales coupons, and presents them during a shopping trip. Thus, probably most of the consumer behavior patterns initially learned by children are ___ of those of their parents, particularly their mom.","duties, errors, copies, causes, necessities",copies
"A funny thing happens to most of our stuff almost immediately after we buy it. What we paid for in the store and brought home was a treasure, a stylish dress, or the latest cell phone. But once it belongs to us and takes up space inside our home, the stuff starts ___. ""Our houses are basically garbage processing centers,"" said one cynical comedian. As soon as stuff enters our homes, it begins the transformation. We get something and it starts out prominently displayed, then gets moved onto a shelf, then stuffed in a closet, then thrown in a box in the garage and held there until it becomes garbage. I definitely think the words 'garage' and 'garbage' must be related.","losing value, looking fresh, getting shared, grabbing attention, becoming unharmful",losing value
"People think identical twins are exactly alike in every way: they look alike, they dress in matching clothes, and they share the same likes and dislikes. Parents of identical twins, however, know differently. In fact, identical twins are ___ individuals. For example, my own children have always shown about a twenty¡©five percent difference in their weight. Also, they don't act alike either. One likes to dance; the other likes to play basketball. Certainly, we encourage them to pursue their individual interests, but they decide to do these activities all on their own.","active, paired, unique, talented, thoughtful",unique
"One late evening in August of 1952, in a theater in New York, a man just opened and closed a piano cover three times before an audience, not hitting any keys for four minutes and thirty¡©three seconds. It was John Cage's 4¡Ç33¡È, the famous musical composition that consists of ___. Cage believed the audience could feel music fully without the artist. Therefore, the only way to prove his belief was to remove the artist from the process of creation. In 4¡Ç33¡È, neither artist nor composer had any impact on the piece, so that Cage had no way of controlling what sounds would be heard by the audience.","lyrics, chorus, silence, laughing, humming",silence
"A tornado touched down in Hammond on June 20, 2002, with tragic results. Towering Pines, the wilderness preserve owned and maintained by the town, was largely destroyed. The tornado was, according to all weather experts in the area, a very rare case in New England. Captain Maria Hinojosa of the New England Weather Bureau says, ""The Hammond tornado was like a snowstorm in South Africa, or a drought in the rain forest. It wasn't impossible.

"The desire to have a fulfilling job¡ªa career that provides a deep sense of purpose, and reflects our values, passions and personality¡ªis a(n) ___. The word 'fulfillment' does not even appear in the famous dictionary, A Dictionary of the English Language, published in 1755. For centuries, most people of the Western world were busy struggling to meet their basic needs. They could not care about whether they had an exciting career that used their talents and improved their well¡©being. Any idea of fulfillment didn't exist in their minds. But today, the spread of material richness has freed our minds to pursue fulfillment from our work.","unclear idea, natural feeling, moral principle, modern concept, unexpected result",modern concept

However, at the third hour, you feel tired and you only type 500 words. That's 500 words less than your usual output! Output decreases over time when there are no breaks. ___ is important.

"The founding population of our direct ancestors is not thought to have been much larger than 2,000 individuals; some think the group was as small as a few hundred. How, then, did we go from such a fragile minority population to a tide of humanity 7 billion strong and growing? There is only one way, according to Richard Potts. You give up on ___. You don't try to beat back the changes. You begin not to care about consistency within a given habitat, because such consistency isn't an option. You adapt to variation itself. It was a brilliant strategy. Instead of learning how to survive in just one or two ecological environments, we took on the entire globe.","stability, morality, fairness, reputation, challenges",stability
"The major change in mapping in the past decade, as opposed to in the previous 6,000 to 10,000 years, is that mapping has become ___. It's not the map itself that has changed. You would recognize a 1940 map and the latest, modern map as having almost the same look. But the old map was a fixed piece of paper, the same for everybody who looked at it. The new map is different for everyone who uses it. You can drag it where you want to go, you can zoom in as you wish, you can switch modes ¡ªtraffic, satellite¡ªyou can fly across your town, even ask questions about restaurants and directions.

"Recently on a flight to Asia, I met Debbie, who was warmly greeted by all of the flight attendants and was even welcomed aboard the plane by the pilot. Amazed at all the attention being paid to her, I asked if she worked with the airline. She did not, but she deserved the attention, for this flight marked the milestone of her flying over 4 million miles with this same airline. During the flight I learned that the airline's CEO personally called her to thank her for using their service for a long time and she received a catalogue of fine luxury gifts to choose from. Debbie was able to acquire this special treatment for one very important reason: she was a ___ customer to that one airline.","courageous, loyal, complaining, dangerous, temporary",loyal
" Perhaps the biggest mistake that most investors make when they first begin investing is getting into a panic over losses. This is a major obstacle to making a strong and long-lasting plan. We work hard for our money, and we want to see it grow and work hard for us. But what most beginning investors don't understand is that investing in the stock market is a risk, and that with risk, you sometimes take losses. Although an investment may be falling in price, it doesn't mean you have to abandon it in a rush. The point is, as investors, we should not focus on short-term losses, but rather on long-term growth. Therefore, be ___ when it comes to not only your stock portfolio but to personal investments as well.","honest, patient, productive, diligent, cooperative",patient
"Consider your typical day. You wake up in the morning and pour yourself juice from oranges grown in Florida and coffee from beans grown in Brazil. Over breakfast, you watch a news program broadcast from New York on your television made in Japan. You get dressed in clothes made of cotton grown in Georgia and sewn in factories in Thailand. Every day, you rely on many people, most of whom you do not know, to provide you with the goods and services that you enjoy. Such ___ is possible because people trade with one another. Those people providing you goods and services are not acting out of generosity. Nor is some government agency directing them to satisfy your desires. Instead, people provide you and other consumers with the goods and services they produce because they get something in return.","interdependence, competition, unfairness, regulation, charity",interdependence
"eople are attracted to individuals and things they cannot readily obtain. In the case with things, people are more attracted to a desired object because it is out of their reach. When the object of desire is finally gained, the attraction for the object rapidly decreases. Christmas presents provide a good example of this phenomenon. Toys children wanted all year long are thrown away several days after they are taken from gift boxes under the tree. The phenomenon also holds true for human interaction, particularly in the early stages of a developing relationship. The common dating rule has scientific merit. An individual should not always make himself or herself readily available to the person they are targeting for a longer-term relationship.

"Language is an ability, inherent in us. We can know the ability only through studying the actual languages. Thus, one of the best reasons for studying languages is to find out about ourselves, about what makes us persons. And the best place to start such study is with our own language. Then what would be the good way to study a language? The best approach is the ___ one. To understand how things are, it is often helpful and sometimes essential to know how they got to be that way. If we are psychologists who want to understand a person's behavior, we must know something about that person's origins and development over time. The same is true of a language.","political, physical, historical, economic, psychological",historical
"A good place for business leaders to start the process of building trust is by becoming more ___ to their employees. Getting out of the office and mixing with employees is a simple solution to a very common trust problem. In organizational improvement workshops, we often ask, ""What is the single greatest barrier to improving communication and trust between you and your manager?"" In many cases, the  first response is, ""I never see her. She's always in a meeting."" The employees cannot develop a perception  of trust with higher-ups when some don't even know what they look like. If leaders seldom come out of the office, choosing to communicate through email instead, they are no longer a part of that organization.","similar, visible, frank, grateful, subjective",visible
"There is a long and honorable history of procrastination to suggest that many ideas and decisions may well improve if postponed. It is something of a truism that to put off making a decision is itself a decision. The parliamentary process is essentially a system of delay and deliberation. So, for that matter, is the creation of a great painting, or an entr?e, or a book, or a building like Blenheim Palace, which took the Duke of Marlborough's architects and laborers 15 years to construct. In the process, the design can mellow and marinate. Indeed, ___ can be the assassin of elegance. As T.H. White, author of Sword in the Stone, once wrote, time ""is not meant to be devoured in an hour or a day, but to be consumed delicately and gradually and without haste."" In other words, what you don't necessarily have to do today, by all means put off until tomorrow.","hurry, caution, complexity, imitation, system",complexity
"According to field researchers, chimpanzees eat some plants for ___. Chimps occasionally eat Aspilia, which is not part of chimps' usual diet because its leaves are rough, sharp and extremely nasty to eat. They usually eat it first thing in the morning and in a very different way than normal food. They do not chew the leaves, but roll them around in their mouth before swallowing. It looks just as if they are taking old¡©fashioned medicine. Some African people use Aspilia to relieve stomach complaints or remove intestinal worms. It also has antibiotic properties.

While it is often considered to be simply ""normal kid stuff,"" it can severely damage the emotional health of the victim. Children often don't tell anyone because of fear of what may happen. It is essential that parents talk to their children on a regular basis about not only their schoolwork and friends but also their safety. Parents should ask their children direct questions about what's going on at school and how they feel about it.

"A man was sightseeing at Niagara Falls. He was so thirsty that he drank some of the water from the falls, but as he turned around, he noticed a sign that said, ""Poisson."" He thought that he had drunk poison, and suddenly felt a sharp stomach pain. Other tourists saw how the man was suffering and quickly took him to the hospital. However, when the physician heard the man's story, he only laughed. The doctor said, ""Sir, what you saw on that sign wasn't the English word, 'poison,' but the French word 'poisson.' The word was 'fishing' or in other words the sign meant, 'Do not fish.'""

"Rhonda, who attended the University of California at Berkeley, was living near campus with several other people¡ªnone of whom knew one another. When the cleaning people came each weekend, they left several rolls of toilet paper in each of the two bathrooms. However, by Monday all the toilet paper would be gone because some people took more than their fair share of the toilet paper. Rhonda had an idea. She put a note in one of the bathrooms asking people not to remove toilet paper, as it was a shared commodity. To her great satisfaction, one roll reappeared in a few hours, and another the next day. In the other note-free bathroom, however, there was no toilet paper until the following weekend, when the cleaning people returned.

"There are a lot of possible connections one can draw between Roman times and today, but perhaps the most important of them is memento mori. At the peak of Rome's power, Roman generals who had won significant victories marched through the middle of the city displaying their spoils. They were hailed, celebrated, and admired. But there was one more element to the ceremony: throughout the day a slave walked next to the general, and in order to prevent the victorious general from falling into arrogance, the slave whispered repeatedly into his ear, memento mori, which means ""remember your mortality."" However, if I were in charge of developing a modern version of the phrase, I would probably pick ""remember your imperfections"" or maybe ""remember your irrationality.""

"The essence of sports is competition. However, it is in the best interest of professional sports clubs for this competition to occur on the playing field, not in the marketplace. The reason is easily observable. Imagine that sports clubs competed for fans in purely competitive markets. The more successful clubs would sell more tickets and would naturally earn higher profits, which would allow these clubs to attract the best players through higher salaries. Over time, these clubs would become so much stronger than the less successful teams that competition on the playing field would become boring for spectators. Weak teams would eventually be forced into bankruptcy, and strong teams would lose fans. Therefore, a professional sports club's economic decisions and those of its rivals are ___.","interdependent, conflicting, unintentional, temporary, ambiguous",interdependent
"Someone who really loves us will be honest with us but will also tend to see us through rose-colored glasses. Sandra Murray and her co-workers studied dating and married couples. They found that the happiest were those who idealized each other, who even saw their partners more positively than their partners saw themselves. When we're in love, we're biased to find those we love not only physically attractive but socially attractive as well. Moreover, the most satisfied married couples tend to approach problems without immediately criticizing their partners.

My boss, however, felt I needed to provide a way for people to contact me. So, I came up with the perfect phone message: ""Hi, this is Randy. My wife and I are going away for a month. I hope you don't have a problem with that, but my boss does."" I then gave the names of Jai's parents and their address. ""If you look them up in the phone book, you can get their number. And then, if you can convince my new in¡©laws that your emergency merits interrupting their only daughter's honeymoon, they have our number."" We didn't get any ___.","gifts, calls, relatives, contracts, promotions",calls
"No one else can experience the way your heart feels about things. No one can see through the lens you use to see life quite the same as you do. Accept this ___. Honor and praise it, too. Do not be quick to compromise it. In your desire to fit in or make others happy, you may be tempted to pretend to be someone you are not. You may even pretend to believe things you don't really believe, or act in ways that are out of character with who you really are. When you do this, you lose out on the real you. The world loses out on you, too. Strive to be a healthy, happy and enlightened person¡ªand then, taking your place alongside your fellow travelers, offer your self to the waiting world.","similarity, endurance, generosity, individuality, compliment",individuality
"Many of the biggest stars in sports are tough to deal with and rarely does an agent develop a connection with them during the first encounter. The most important lesson I learned as a sports agent is that it isn't just about signing a million¡©dollar contract. When I am working with a client, there are hundreds of little things that take place during the weeks before we are ready to sit down and negotiate. Small stuff plays a big part in how satisfied and comfortable my clients are with me and my services. I often express interest in their recent vacation or how their children are doing in school. Paying attention to ___ is a huge sign of respect to today's top athletes.","details, deals, results, rewards, schedules",details
"A new study suggests that ___ influence our experience of the food. People perceived yogurt as denser and more expensive when eaten with lighter spoons, the researchers report today in the journal Flavour, probably because those spoons matched their expectations. But yogurt tasted with that spoon was also rated as less sweet than when eaten with heavier or larger spoons. And the people thought yogurt tasted sweeter when they ate it with a white spoon than with a black one. In a final experiment with different types of cheese, the researchers found that people rated cheese as saltier when they sampled it with a knife insead of a fork, spoon, or toothpick. This may have been because eating with a knife is an unusual behavior, the researchers speculated, or because it reminded people of using a knife to try samples in a cheese shop, where cheeses tend to be more aged and therefore saltier.","ages, places, genders, utensils, ingredients",utensils
"People make purchasing decisions by choosing between alternatives or by rejecting certain options. But a new study in the Journal of Consumer Research finds that focusing on rejecting an option can lead consumers to ___ their preferences. Why does this happen? When consumers reject options, they need to decide which alternative they do not want, so they focus on options that are less preferred in order to assess if they should reject those options. This shift of focus makes them more likely to notice appealing features of the initially less preferred option. For example, a newly married couple who prefers an apartment closer to the subway station because of easy access to it, but doesn't have enough money, was told to select an apartment to 'reject': an apartment closer to the subway station or a less expensive one farther from the station. Simply instructing them to decide which one they would like to 'reject' makes them more likely to choose the less expensive apartment as their place to live in. Similarly, those who said they would prefer a less-expensive apartment selected the apartment close to the station.","mix, reverse, conceal, maintain, neutralize",reverse
"It is not a new idea that cooking is an activity that ___ humans. In 1773, the Scottish writer James Boswell, noting that ""no beast is a cook,"" called Homo sapiens ""the cooking animal."" Fifty years later, in The Physiology of Taste, the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin claimed that cooking made us who we are; by teaching men to use fire, it had ""done the most to advance the cause of civilization."" More recently, L?i-Strauss, writing in The Raw and the Cooked in 1964, reported that many of the world's cultures entertained a similar view, regarding cooking as the symbolic activity that ""establishes the difference between animals and people.""","defines, protects, harms, confuses, entertains",defines
"The biggest trap many family gardeners fall into is creating a garden that is too large. Even though you may have the best of intentions, over time a garden that is too large will become a maintenance nightmare. My family, like many others, eagerly planted large gardens only to cut back slowly on the time devoted to gardening. Sometime in September, we ended up with a garden full of overripened fruit and out¡©of¡©control, overgrown plants. This situation is not enjoyable for adult gardeners, let alone for children. Most children (and many adults) won't enjoy spending their warm sunny days tending an overgrown garden plot. When thinking about the size of your family garden, be ___. Plan the size according to the time your family can devote to the garden.","diligent, ambitious, realistic, challenging, cooperative",realistic
"Teams made up of diverse specialists are infamous for their inability to get things done. Despite the best¡©laid plans of the managers who assemble such teams, the differences among members frequently lead to poor communication, conflict, and confusion. Members new to one another simply don't understand when and how to communicate. Some groups never master this; and even in groups that do, the process takes time, slowing progress toward team goals. ___ can help a group overcome this obstacle: Once a team has learned when and how to communicate on one project, it can carry those skills over to the next. Research shows that many teams struggle to make use of the knowledge each individual brings to the task, because their members don't know who has what information. Discovering this knowledge can take time and effort; the more frequently the same individuals work together, the better an organization performs.","Familiarity, Motivation, Expertise, Leadership, Competition",Familiarity
"Compared with farmers, hunter-gatherers led a more ___ life. Modern anthropologists who have spent time with surviving hunter-gatherer groups report that gathering food only accounts for a small proportion of their time¡ªfar less than would be required to produce the same quantity of food via farming. The !Kung Bushmen of the Kalahari, for example, typically spend twelve to nineteen hours a week collecting food, and the Hazda nomads of Tanzania spend less than fourteen hours. That leaves a lot of time free for leisure activities, socializing, and so on. When asked by an anthropologist why his people had not adopted farming, one Bushman replied, ""Why should we plant, when there are so many mongongo nuts in the world?"" In effect, hunter-gatherers work two days a week and have fiveday weekends.","leisurely, systematic, dangerous, stressful, isolated",leisurely
"John Wooden, the great UCLA basketball coach who produced 10 NCAA championship teams in 12 years during the 1960s and 1970s, perfectly exemplified the power of ___. In the fascinating film documentary The UCLA Dynasty, one player recalled, ""There was a way to do everything. You could have taken UCLA people who played in 1955, 1965, 1970, and 1975; put them on the same team; and they would have been able to play with each other, instantly."" Wooden ran his drills with rare modifications over the course of three decades. Drills would start and end like clockwork, the same drills performed before the national championship as at the beginning of the season so that, in the words of a star player, ""By the time the games came along, they just became memorized exhibitions of brilliance.""","honesty, analysis, cooperation, consistency, encouragement",consistency
"Today it often seems we remember very little. When I wake up, the first thing I do is check my day planner, which remembers my schedule so that I don't have to. When I climb into my car, I enter my destination into the GPS, whose spatial memory supplants my own. When I sit down to work, I open up a notebook that holds the contents of my interviews. Now, thanks to the Internet, I rarely have to remember anything more than the right set of search terms to access humankind's collective memory. Growing up, in the days when you still had to press seven buttons, or turn a clunky rotary dial, to make a telephone call, I could recall the numbers of all my close friends and family. Today, I'm not sure if I know more than four phone numbers by heart. And that's probably more than most people do. Our gadgets ___ the need to remember such things.","create, eliminate, promote, solidify, overestimate",eliminate
"You can actually become your own cheerleader by talking to yourself positively and then acting as if you were already the person that you wanted to be. Act as though you were trying out for the role of a positive, cheerful, happy, and likable person. Walk, talk, and act as if you were already that person. Treat everyone you meet as though you had just won an award for being the very best person in your industry or as though you had just won the lottery. You will be amazed at how much better you feel about yourself after just a few minutes of ___.","pretending, competing, purchasing, complaining, aplogizing",pretending
"The English political scientist John Stuart Mill realized that it is not only within the goods market that a lack of competition is able to push prices up. Monopoly effects can also emerge in the ___ market. He pointed to the case of goldsmiths, who earned much higher wages than workers of a similar skill because they were perceived to be trustworthy¡ªa characteristic that is rare and not easily provable. This created a significant barrier to entry so that those working with gold could demand a monopoly price for their services. Mill realized that the goldsmiths' situation was not an isolated case. He noted that large sections of the working classes were barred from entering skilled professions because they entailed many years of education and training. The cost of supporting someone through this process was out of reach for most families, so those who could afford it were able to enjoy wages far above what might be expected.","labor, street, gold, property, capital",labor
"Changing our food habits is one of the hardest things we can do, because the impulses governing our preferences are often hidden, even from ourselves. And yet adjusting what you eat is entirely possible. We do it all the time. Were this not the case, the food companies that launch new products each year would be wasting their money. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, housewives from East and West Germany tried each other's food products for the first time in decades. It didn't take long for those from the East to realize that they preferred Western yogurt to their own. Equally, those from the West discovered a liking for the honey and vanilla wafer biscuits of the East. From both sides of the wall, these German housewives showed a remarkable ___ in their food preferences.","simplicity, flexibility, difference, resistance, consistency",flexibility
"Psychologists have spent years trying to discover the answer to the question, ""What makes innovators different?"" In one of the most thorough examinations of the subject, Harvard researchers spent six years and interviewed three thousand executives to find out. Their conclusions are interesting, but the investigators could have saved themselves a lot of time by simply asking Steve Jobs. According to the Harvard research, the number one skill that separates innovators from noncreative professionals is ""associating"": the ability to successfully connect seemingly unrelated questions, problems, or ideas from different fields. ""The more diverse our experience and knowledge, the more connections the brain can make. Fresh inputs trigger new associations; for some, these lead to ___.""","novel ideas, scientific proofs, moral lessons, cultural diversity, mistaken conclusions",novel ideas
"A political scientist has done a series of experiments to demonstrate the positive effects of ___. In those experiments, he used computer-simulated agents that were programmed to solve problems. He set up a series of groups of ten or twenty agents, with each agent endowed with a different set of skills, and had them solve a relatively sophisticated problem. Individually, some of the agents were very good at solving the problem while others were less effective. But what he found was that a group made up of some smart agents and some not-so-smart agents almost always did better than a group made up just of smart agents. You could do as well or better by selecting a group randomly and letting it solve the problem as by spending a lot of time trying to find the smart agents and then putting them alone on the problem.","diversity, creativity, equality, familiarity, practicality",diversity
"When we behave irrationally, our behavior usually seems reasonable to us. When challenged, the mind says (to itself), ""Why are these people giving me a hard time? I'm just doing what makes sense. Any reasonable person would see that!"" In short, we naturally think that our thinking is fully justified. As far as we can tell, we are only doing what is right and proper and reasonable. Any fleeting thoughts suggesting that we might be at fault typically are ___ by more powerful self-justifying thoughts: ""I don't mean any harm. I'm just! I'm fair! It's the  others who are wrong!"" It is important to recognize this nature of the human mind as its natural state. In other words, humans don't have to learn self-justifying, self-serving, self-deceptive thinking and behavior. These patterns are innate in every one of us.","spread, unveiled, fortified, overcome, authorized",overcome
"Reading seems to be an important activity that helps teenagers secure a good ___. Some researchers from Oxford University studied 17,000 people all born in the same week in May, 1970. They are now grown up and in their early 40s and the sociological study has tracked their progress through time. At the age of 16, in 1986, they were asked which activities they did in their spare time for pleasure. These answers were then checked against what they were engaged in at the age of 33, in 2003. The researchers found that there was a 39 percent probability that girls would be in professional or managerial posts at 33 if they had read books at 16, but only a 25 percent chance if they had not. For boys the figures rose from 48 percent to 58 percent if they read books.","job, habit, attitude, education, relationship",job
"When we are children, our bodies grow automatically. A year goes by, and we become taller, stronger, more capable of doing new things and facing new challenges. I think many people carry into adulthood a subconscious belief that mental, spiritual, and emotional growth follows a similar pattern. Time goes by, and we simply get better. We're like Charlie Brown in Charles Schulz's Peanuts comic strip, who once said, ""I think I've discovered the secret of life¡ªyou just hang around until you get used to it."" The problem is that we don't improve by simply living. We have to be ___ about it. Musician Bruce Springsteen commented, ""A time comes when you need to stop waiting for the man you want to become and start being the man you want to be."" No one improves by accident. Personal growth doesn't just happen on its own.","content, defensive, intentional, thankful, self-confident",intentional
"Table manners help us to see that politeness is not, after all, a disadvantage. Although the ill¡©mannered person can grab more of the food, he will receive less of the affection; and fellowship is the real meaning of the meal. Next time, he will not be invited. Politeness makes you a part of things and so gives you an enduring edge over those who never acquired it. And this gives us a clue to the real nature of rudeness: to be rude is not just to be selfish, in the way that children (until taught otherwise) and animals are instinctively selfish; it is to be ___. Even in the friendliest gathering, the rude person will reveal, by some word or gesture, that he is not really part of it. Of course he is there, a living organism, with wants and needs. But he does not belong in the conversation.","clever, alone, talkative, impatient, curious",alone
"A ratio is a way of expressing the relationship between one number and another. If there is one teacher to fifty students, the teacher/student ratio is one to fifty, and the student/teacher ratio is fifty to one. If a very wealthy prince were being tutored by fifty teachers, the teacher/student ratio would be fifty to one, and the student/teacher ratio would be one to fifty. As you can see, the ___ in which the numbers are compared is important. That is, if the arrangement of the two items, teacher and student, changes, the ratio of the items will change, too.","time, order, speed, height, movement",order
"Imagine that you are lying on a bed in a dental clinic. If you were told ""only two times more"" versus ""only ten times more,"" wouldn't you use different mental strategies to try to cope? With either scenario, you would pull out the comforting thought of ""only one more and then it's the last one"" at different times; you would save your most distracting fantasy for a different point. ___ information lets us know what internal coping strategy is likely to work best during a stressor. A simple example: you have some minor surgery. You are told that on the first post-surgical day there is going to be a lot of pain, whereas by the second day, you will just feel a bit achy. Armed with that information, you are more likely to plan on watching distracting videos on the first day and to devote day two to writing poems.","Tentative, Deceptive, Predictive, Subjective, Alternative",Predictive
"Dozens of studies have demonstrated the ___ nature of self-supervision. For instance, people who were asked to make tricky choices and trade-offs¡ªsuch as setting up a wedding registry or ordering a new computer¡ªwere worse at focusing and solving problems than others who had not made the tough choices. In one study, some people were asked to restrain their emotions while watching a sad movie about sick animals. Afterward, they exhibited less physical endurance than others who had let the tears flow freely. The research shows that we burn up self-control in a wide variety of situations: managing the impression we are making on others; coping with fears; controlling our spending; trying to focus on simple instructions such as ""Don't think of a white bear""; and many, many others.","nurturing, hesitating, rewarding, misleading, exhausting",exhausting
"The relationship between physical products and individual ownership is undergoing a profound evolution. We don't want the CD; we want the music it plays. We don't want the disc; we want the storage it holds. We don't want the answering machine; we want the messages it saves. We don't want the DVD; we want the movie it carries. In other words, we want not the stuff but the needs or experiences it fulfills. As our possessions ""dematerialize"" into the intangible, our preconceptions of ownership are changing, creating a dotted line between ""what's mine,"" ""what's yours,"" and ""what's ours."" This shift is fueling a world where ___ has more value than possession, and as Kevin Kelly, a founder of Wired magazine, puts it, where ""access is better than ownership.""","disposal, donation, usage, cooperation, intelligence",usage
"Scientists and educators have long sought to understand the emergence of expertise, artistic and otherwise. Many researchers have argued that exceptional achievement can simply come down to ___. Studies of eminent scientists in the 1950s supported this view by underscoring the individuals' capacity for endurance, concentration and commitment to effortful practice. Benjamin Bloom, an education psychologist, wrote in 1985 that none of his subjects achieved expertise without a supportive environment and a long and intensive period of training. This education came first from encouraging instructors and later from demanding master teachers. A few years later psychologist K. Anders Ericsson of Florida State University conducted studies of experts in piano, violin, chess, or athletics. The investigations revealed that a person's level of achievement correlated strongly with the amount of practice put in.","hard work, deep insight, physical strength, emotional stability, extraordinary talent",hard work
"The idea that artists have a unique message to communicate is only a few hundred years old. For most of European history, artists were considered primarily craftsmen. When a noble contracted with a painter for a work, the contract specified details like the quantities of gold and blue paint to appear in the work, the deadline, and penalties for delays. A contract in 1485 between the painter Domenico Ghirlandaio and a client specified that Ghirlandaio would ""colour the panel at his own expense with good colours and with powdered gold on such ornaments as demand it ... and the blue must be ultramarine of the value about four florins per ounce"". In some contracts, artists were paid by the time worked rather than a fixed price for the completed work. These contract details show us that art was considered to be a ___¡ªa very different concept of the artist than we hold today.","trade, hobby, symbol, miracle, blessing",trade
"If we can't have everything we want today, what do we do? We are forced to make choices. We must choose some goods and services and not others. Sometimes this kind of choosing can be visibly painful. Have you ever watched children in a toy store with a gift certificate in hand? It can take them all day before they make a choice. And instead of bubbling with excitement over the toy they bought, they usually appear frustrated over not being able to walk away with everything! Life is like that. ___ governs us. Because we cannot have everything all at once, we are forever forced to make choices. We can use our resources to satisfy only some of our wants, leaving many others unsatisfied.","Scarcity, Morality, Knowledge, Reputation, Compassion",Scarcity
"Once a hand or gripper has been directed to an object by reaching, it can be grasped. Grasping requires that fingers hold an object securely. A secure grip is one in which the object won't slip or move, especially when displaced by an external force. Your grasp on a hammer, for example, would not be secure if knocking against something caused you to drop it. One precondition of a firm grasp is that the forces applied by the fingers balance each other so as not to disturb the object's position. The characteristics of an object such as its geometric configuration and mass distribution may demand that some fingers apply greater force than others to maintain ___. The grasp and support forces must also match overall object mass and fragility. An egg requires a more delicate touch than a rock.","distance, efficiency, mobility, direction, stability",stability
"A sleeping mother has the ability to identify the particular cry of her own baby. This is one of the bonding factors that has been forgotten because of the way in which we live today. Typically, there is now only one newborn baby in any family house or apartment, so there is no way to test this ability. In an ancient tribe, however, living in small huts in a tiny village settlement, a mother would have been able to hear any of the babies crying in the night. If she woke up every time one of them screamed for food, she might get no sleep at all. During the course of evolution she became programmed to awake only at the sound of her own particular baby. This ___ is still there to this day, even though it is seldom used.","affection, creativity, sociability, intolerance, sensitivity",sensitivity
"¡°What¡¯s in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet.¡± This thought of Shakespeare¡¯s points up a difference between roses and, say, paintings. Natural objects, such as roses, are not ___. They are not taken as vehicles of meanings and messages. They belong to no tradition, strictly speaking have no style, and are not understood within a framework of culture and convention. Rather, they are sensed and savored relatively directly, without intellectual mediation, and so what they are called, either individually or collectively, has little bearing on our experience of them. What a work of art is titled, on the other hand, has a significant effect on the aesthetic face it presents and on the qualities we correctly perceive in it. A painting of a rose, by a name other than the one it has, might very well smell different, aesthetically speaking. The painting titled Rose of Summer and an indiscernible painting titled Vermillion Womanhood are physically, but also semantically and aesthetically, distinct objects of art.","changed, classified, preserved, controlled, interpreted",interpreted
